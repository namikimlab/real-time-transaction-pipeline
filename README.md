# Real-Time Transaction Monitoring Pipeline

ðŸš€ **Full-Stack Streaming Data Engineering Portfolio Project**

---

## Architecture

- Kafka (KRaft mode)
- Spark Structured Streaming (Real-Time ETL)
- Postgres OLAP (Fact-Dimension schema)
- dbt (Data Modeling)
- Airflow (Batch Orchestration)
- Metabase (BI Dashboard)
- Docker Compose (Full stack deployment)

---

## Use Case

Simulates real-time payment transaction system with real-time fraud detection + daily revenue aggregations.

## Pipeline Diagram

*(add your architecture diagram here â€” I can generate one for you if you want)*

---

## Streaming Logic

- Simulated transaction generator (Kafka Producer)
- Spark Structured Streaming reads from Kafka
- Real-time fraud detection logic:
  - High amount threshold
  - Foreign transaction flag
  - Suspicious lat/lon coordinates
- Writes to OLAP Postgres

---

## Batch Logic

- dbt runs daily aggregations
- Airflow orchestrates dbt jobs
- Metabase dashboards for business analytics

---

## Tech Stack

- Kafka (7.5.0 KRaft)
- Spark 3.5.0
- dbt 1.7.9
- Airflow 2.9.0
- Postgres 15
- Metabase latest
- Docker Compose

---

## Setup

```bash
git clone ...
docker compose up -d
# seed dim tables:
cd postgres
python seed_dim_tables.py
```

## Dashboard Previews

## Key Skills Demonstrated
